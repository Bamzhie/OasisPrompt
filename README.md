# OasisPrompt App

OasisPrompt is a platform designed for creating, managing, and sharing prompts. Users can utilize Google Authentication to create an account, granting access to personalized features such as prompt creation, editing, and deletion. The application is built using React for the frontend, MongoDB for the backend, and Google Auth for user authentication.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure authentication powered by Google Auth. Users can sign in with their Google accounts to access the app.

- **Prompt Creation and Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete prompts. All prompts are associated with the user's account for easy management.

- **Personalized Profile Page:** Each user has a personalized profile page where they can view and edit their prompts.

- **Dashboard:** A dashboard displays all prompts created by users, providing a centralized view of all prompts within the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store and manage user data and prompts.
